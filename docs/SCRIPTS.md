# Scripts Reference

## Overview

The `scripts/` directory contains operational scripts for managing the Sealed Exchange system. These scripts handle deployment initialization, trading operations, and system monitoring.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** These scripts are designed for **localhost development with Hardhat** only. They use mock FHE encryption and hardcoded addresses from local deployments. For production/testnet deployments, you'll need to modify the scripts or use the UI interface.

## Script Categories

1. **Initialization** - Setup and configuration
2. **Trading** - Order submission and batch operations
3. **Balance Management** - Deposits, withdrawals, minting
4. **Monitoring** - Logging and inspection
5. **Administration** - Asset and market management

## Running Scripts

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Local network 
pnpm dlx tsx scripts/SCRIPT_NAME.ts --network localhost
```

### With Custom Parameters

Most scripts support environment variables for configuration:

```bash
# Example: Mint specific amount
AMOUNT=1000000 TOKEN=CUSDT pnpm dlx tsx scripts/mint-initial-tokens.ts --network localhost
```
